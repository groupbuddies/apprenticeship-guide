Weekly Report
=================

At the end of each week, both the mentor and the apprentice need to fill in a small report. The purpose of the report is to gather information to improve both the ongoing apprenticeship and the following ones.

The main goal of the weekly report is to gather the following information:

* Topics covered during the week;
* Feedback from the mentor;
* Feedback from the apprentice.

An online form is enough for the weekly report. The tool is optional, as long as it contains the necessary answers.

**For the Mentor**

1. Did you feel overwhelmed with the amount of work?
2. How would you rate your performance (qualitatively)?
3. Are you satisfied with your week? If not, please explain why.
4. Can you write some lines about what was done during the week and how the apprentice reacted to it?

**For the Apprentice**

1. Did you feel overwhelmed with the amount of work?
2. How would you rate your performance (qualitatively)?
3. Are you satisfied with your week? If not, please explain why.
