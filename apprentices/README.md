## Rules

### Slack

The apprentice joins the same org as the rest of the team. But he should only join channels related to the project(s) he is working on, and optionally the #blog-posts, #community, #design, #development, #fridaytalks, #general and/or #random.

A computer with either Linux or OSX is required. There are no other strong requirements, as long as the apprentice is comfortable and productive with whatever he's using.
