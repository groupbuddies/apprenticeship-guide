Wenkly Evaluation
=================

By the end of each week we need to get feedback from the apprentice and make an evaluation.

- [ ] Review the topics approached during the week.
- [ ] Give instructions for the following week.
- [ ] Assign work for weekend
- [ ] Register feedback from the mentor.
- [ ] Register feedback from the apprentice.
- [ ] Review behavior from both the mentor and the apprentice.

The idea of this items is for us to register information for the following apprenticeships.

With this we will be able to keep making adjustments.
