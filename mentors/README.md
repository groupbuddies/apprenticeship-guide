Mentors
=======

Mentors are replaced often, and it's preferable not to keep the same mentor for more than two weeks. Rotations will happen according to the availability of the team, and the subjects being taught.
A mentor is fully responsible for the apprentice's work. This includes all daily work as well as homework.

Mentors are able to choose what they're going to teach and how, as long as it is in the scope of the goals.

## Planning

Each week must be planned the week before. But this doesn't mean that he can't change the planning at any time. The point of having a plan is to make sure mentors are not going to do whatever they feel like at the moment and that they are going to think things through. Moreover the planning will help for the next mentor to prepare his work.

Planning each week isn't only the responsibility of the current mentor. Other mentors and the coordinator should be available to help. The week doesn't need to be planned in detail, but there should be an idea of what's going to happen. It's important to have feedback from more people, especially on each mentor's first week with the apprentice. Even for pair programming a mentor should know what he is going to work during those days.
During the day, each mentor can perform the following type of tasks:

* Pair programming;
* Individual tasks;
* Exercises.

A mentor can assign what he feels more comfortable with, or feels like it's better.

Homework also needs to be planned. Again, it doesn't mean it can't change at any time. The homework must be of the following types:

* Research;
* Unfinished tasks or tasks assigned by the mentor;
* Exercises.

### Planning Report

The planning report must contain a general description of what's going to happen during the week, links to resources to be used, and a set of goals to guide the apprentice.

The goals are important. From our experience, the absence of goals can make certain apprentices think that they're not doing well enough.

Take the following as an example:

```
This week is going to cover two main topics, git and tests.

The apprentice will learn how to create feature branches, open acceptable pull requests and write a script to automate the process.

We are also going to cover basic theory on tests. What can/should we test, how are tests usefull, and apply the knowledge in pull requests to TheCouncil.

Resources:
http://guides.rubyonrails.org/testing.html

Goals:

* Create and merge branches.
* Open and close pull requests.
* Write good names for your commits.
```

The tool for this report is optional, as long as it's consistent.
