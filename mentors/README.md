Mentors
=======

Mentors are replaced every two weeks. During this time he is fully responsible for the apprentice. This includes the work day as well as preparing homework.

Mentors are able to choose what they're going to teach and how, as long as it is in the scope of the goals.

## Planning

Each week must be planned the week before. But it doesn't mean that he can't change the planning at any time. The point of having a plan is to make sure mentors are not going to do whatever they feel like on the moment. Moreover the planning will help for the next mentor to prepare his work.

During the day, each mentor can perform the following type of tasks:

* Pair programming;
* Individual tasks;
* Exercises.

The week must be planned ahead, even for pair programming a mentor should know what he is going to work during those days. The planning doesn't need to go into many details and can change at any time.

A mentor can assign what he feels more comfortable with, or feels like it's better.

Homework also needs to be planned. Again, it doesn't mean he canâ€™t change it at any time. The homework must be of the following types:

* Research;
* Make PRs;
* Make exercises.
