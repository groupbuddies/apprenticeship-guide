Mentors
=======

Mentors change every two weeks. During this period a mentor is fully responsible for the apprentice. This means during the day and homework.

Mentors are able to choose what they're going to teach and how, as long as it is in the scope of the goals.

## Planning

The planning for each week must be done on the week before. This doesn't mean a mentor has to strictly follow the plan, it can be changed it at any time. The point of having a plan is to make sure mentors are not going to do what looks easier in the moment and they are going to think things through. Not only that, but the planning will help the next mentor to prepare his work.

Planning each week isn't only the responsibility of the current mentor, the other mentors and the coordinator should be available to help. The week doesn't need to be planned in detail, but there should be an idea of what's going to happen. It's important to have feedback from more people, especially on each mentor's first week with the apprentice. Even for pair programming a mentor should know what he is going to work during those days.
During the day, each mentor can assign the following type of tasks:

* Pair programming;
* Individual tasks;
* Exercises.

A mentor can assign what he feels more comfortable with, or feels like it's better.

Homework also needs to be planned. Again, it doesn't mean it can't change at any time. The home work must be of the following types:

* Research;
* Unfinished tasks or tasks assigned by the mentor;
* Do exercises.

### Planning Report

The planning report must contain a general description of what's going to happen during the week, links to resources to be used, and a set of goals to guide the apprentice.

The goals are important. From experience, the absence of goals can make certain apprentices think that they're not doing well enough.

Take the following as an example.

```
This week is going to cover two main topics, git and tests.

The apprentice will learn how to create feature branches, open acceptable pull requests and write a script to automate the process.

We are also going to cover basic theory on tests. What can/should we test, how are tests usefull, and apply the knowledge in pull requests to TheCouncil.

Resources:
http://guides.rubyonrails.org/testing.html

Goals:

* Create and merge branches.
* Open and close pull requests.
* Write good names for your commits.
```

The tool for this report is optional, as long as it's consistent.
