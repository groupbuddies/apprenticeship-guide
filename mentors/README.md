Mentors
=======

Mentors change every two weeks. During this time a mentor is fully responsible for the apprentice. This means during the day and homework.

Mentors are able to choose what they're going to teach and how, as long as it is in the scope of the goals.

## Planning

Each week must be planned on the previous week. But this doesn't mean that you can't change the planning at any time. The point of having a plan is to make sure mentors are not going to do whatever they feel like at the moment. Not only that, but the planning will help the next mentor to prepare his work.

During the day, each mentor can assign the following type of tasks:

* Pair programming;
* Individual tasks;
* Exercises.

The week must be planned, even for pair programming a mentor should know what he is going to work during those days. The planning doesn't need to go into many details and can change at any time.

A mentor can assign what he feels more comfortable with, or feels like it's better.

Homework also needs to be planned. Again, it doesn't mean it canâ€™t change at any time. The home work must be of the following types:

* Research;
* Open Pull Requests for unfinished tasks or tasks assigned by the mentor;
* Do exercises.

### Planning Report

The planning report must contain a general description of what's going to happen during the week, and links to resources to be used. Take the following as an example.

```
This week is going to cover two main topics, git and tests.

The apprentice will learn how to create feature branches, open acceptable pull requests and write a script to automate the process.

We are also going to cover basic theory on tests. What can/should we test, how are tests usefull, and apply the knowledge in pull requests to TheCouncil.

```

The tool for this report is optional, as long as it's consistent.
